Simple analogue drum machine with kick, snare, and hi-hat.

This is based [this schematics from Delptronics](http://mickeydelp.com/blog/anatomy-of-a-drum-machine) but is missing many drums and the hardware sequencer. 

See [MIDIMonkey](https://github.com/aleh/MIDIMonkey) for a simple MIDI trigger and [NoiseChip](https://github.com/aleh/NoiseChip) for the "noise" chip referenced in the schematics.

Note that the PCB layout is not good, I was using it only to guide my assembly on protoboards.
